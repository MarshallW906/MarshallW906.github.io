## Game Engine Course Project

These are things I implemented in Game Engine Dev class (CSCI 522) by myself.

### CPU/GPU Collision check (Performance comparison)

- GPU Code was implemented by OpenGL compute shader
- Many static imrods with obvious overlaps were spawned for collision detection

### An basic 3D Audio system implemented by XAudio2

- 3D spatial effect
- Videos:
  - Walk sound attached to a soldier, & ambient sound: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Zggp_4pUJq4)

## Game Engine Stuff
These are things I implemented in Game Engine Dev class (CSCI 522) by myself.

### CPU/GPU Collision check (Performance comparison)
- GPU Code was implemented by OpenGL compute shader
- Many static imrods with obvious overlaps were spawned for collision detection
- Video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/bcQw3MEv5ts)

### An basic 3D Audio system implemented by XAudio2
- 3D spatial effect
- Videos: 
  - Walk sound attached to a soldier, & ambient sound: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Zggp_4pUJq4)
  - 3D Sound Music: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/NQvsFHRlgW8)

### An animation system with full/partial/additive animation
- Also a basic 3rd-person controller was implemented
- Videos: 
  - 3rd person controller with basic actions: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/afH72g8HpFE)
  - Additive animation: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/sf3T9ywaCkg)
  - Partial animation: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/H27tRPsZw9s)

### AABB Bounding volumes & Culling
- A basic culling test using camera view frustum & AABB.
- Video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/TEKxZajKNAQ)

### A patrol/aim demo
- One soldier patrolling between randomly selected different waypoint
- Another soldier walk to his destination point and then start aim at an imrod.
- Video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/8mtKkRWi5Jk)

## Rendering stuff
### A PBR demo with Specular IBL & HDR Tone Mapping
- CSCI 580 (3D Graphics & Rendering) Final Project (collaborated with another two)
- Video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/HpdTTB1vymI)

## Game Demo
### A 3D sci-fi racing game by Unity3D: "No more Benzin"

- Collaborate with another 4 people during USC MEGA Game Jam in Oct 26-27.
- I did UI, general game control, and finalization of this game.
- Game Repo: [Youtube](https://github.com/benhaderle/RacingJamGame)
- Gameplay Video: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/1le_Cl_cutM)

### A simple 2D adventure game demo by Babylon.js(TypeScript)

- Game Repo: [Github](https://github.com/MarshallW906/JumpCastle-GameDemo)
- It is put on [Github Page](https://marshallw906.github.io/JumpCastle-GameDemo/)

## Miscellaneous
### Anonymous Forum (Collaborate with classmates)

- I designed an anonymous forum's backend with other 3 classmates during my undergraduate studies.
- Here is the group: [Github](https://github.com/Chun-Ge)
- The Forum's backend repo: [Github](https://github.com/Chun-Ge/Shudong-Backend)

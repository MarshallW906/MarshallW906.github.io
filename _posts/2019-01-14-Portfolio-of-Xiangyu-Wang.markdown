## Game Engine Stuff
These are things I implemented in Game Engine Dev class.

### CPU/GPU Collision check (Performance comparison)
- GPU Code was implemented by OpenGL compute shader
- Many static imrods with obvious overlaps were spawned for collision detection
- Video: https://youtu.be/bcQw3MEv5ts 

### An animation system with full/partial/additive animation
- Also a basic 3rd-person controller was implemented
- Videos: 
  - AABB & Camera view frustum Culling test: https://youtu.be/afH72g8HpFE
  - Additive animation: https://youtu.be/sf3T9ywaCkg
  - Partial animation: https://youtu.be/H27tRPsZw9s

### An basic 3D Audio system implemented by XAudio2
- 3D spatial effect
- Videos: 
  - Walk sound attached to a soldier, & ambient sound: https://youtu.be/Zggp_4pUJq4
  - 3D Sound Music: https://youtu.be/NQvsFHRlgW8


### AABB Bounding volumes & Culling
- A basic culling test using camera view frustum & AABB.
- Video: https://youtu.be/TEKxZajKNAQ

### A patrol/aim demo
- One soldier patrolling between randomly selected different waypoint
- Another soldier walk to his destination point and then start aim at an imrod.

## Rendering stuff
### A PBR demo with Specular IBL & HDR Tone Mapping

## Miscellaneous
## Anonymous Forum (Collaborate with classmates)

- I designed an anonymous forum's backend with other 3 classmates during my undergraduate studies.
- Here is the group: https://github.com/Chun-Ge
- The Forum's backend repo: https://github.com/Chun-Ge/Shudong-Backend
